InsurRateX: 

Tagline: “The Universal Exchange for Insurance Rating Intelligence.”

InsurRateX is a cloud-native, pluggable interoperability platform that connects policy systems like Guidewire, Duck Creek, or Salesforce with any rating engine — whether on-premises or SaaS. Acting as the universal exchange, it standardizes data through a canonical model, manages transformations, and accelerates product rollout across lines like Inland Marine, General Liability, and Property.
By embedding insurance rating intelligence, InsurRateX empowers business and technical teams alike with AI-assisted mapping, reusable integrations, and a self-service experience. This reduces development effort, shortens time to market, and ensures consistent, auditable rating across organizations.

So your product positioning becomes:
* The Universal Exchange → emphasizes interoperability and reusability.
* Insurance Rating Intelligence → emphasizes AI-driven mapping, automation, and insights.


Prototype Scope Document: InsurRateX
The Universal Exchange for Insurance Rating Intelligence

Objective
Build a cloud-native, reusable interoperability platform that enables insurance policy systems (e.g., Guidewire, Salesforce, Duck Creek) to exchange rating data seamlessly with multiple rating engines (on-prem or SaaS).
The platform — InsurRateX — will:
* Act as the universal exchange for insurance rating data.
* Provide insurance rating intelligence through AI-assisted mapping and transformation.
* Enable reusability across organizations with minimal customization, through modular adapters and a canonical model.
* Support iterative development of mappings, tracked via tools like JIRA.

In-Scope (Prototype Deliverables)
1. Cloud-Native Foundation
* Kubernetes deployment to support scalability, low-latency, and fast developer experience.
* Stateless microservices architecture with REST APIs.
* CI/CD pipeline for containerized deployment.
2. Canonical Data Model (CDM)
* JSON schema representing policy, risk, and coverage data.
* Validations for inbound requests.
* Extensible design to support multiple product lines (Inland Marine, General Liability, Deluxe Property, etc.).
3. Reusability Features
* Plug-and-play adapters for upstream systems (e.g., Guidewire, Salesforce).
* Reusable mapping artifacts stored in a registry with versioning.
* Extensible connector framework for new rating engines with minimal coding.
* Configuration-driven customization (e.g., lookup tables, product definitions) instead of bespoke code.
4. Guidewire Payload Handling
* Accept Guidewire-style JSON payload as input.
* Transform request into canonical form.
* Send request to mock rating engine adapter.
* Transform rating engine response back into Guidewire-understandable JSON payload.
5. Mapping & Transformation Engine
* Declarative, version-controlled mapping rules.
* Transformations: lookups, conditionals, format conversions.
* Iterative mapping updates tracked as JIRA stories.
6. Connectors / Adapters
* Mock Guidewire adapter (JSON input/output).
* Mock rating engine adapter (JSON engine request/response).
7. Orchestration Layer
* Stateless orchestrator service to handle request routing, retries, and correlation IDs.
* Extensible to multiple rating engines and product lines.
8. Self-Service Business UI (Prototype)
* Mapping canvas (drag/drop source → canonical target).
* Test harness to upload payloads and preview transformations.
* Versioning & basic approval workflow.
9. AI Assistance (Prototype)
* AI-driven mapping suggestions.
* Natural language → draft transformation rule.
10. Observability & Audit
* Structured logging with correlation IDs.
* Trace request path and applied mapping version.
* Simple dashboard for monitoring and debugging.

Out of Scope (Prototype Phase)
* Full enterprise security (use basic auth for POC).
* Integration with real Guidewire/rating engines (use mocks).
* High-volume performance testing.
* Advanced business rule authoring (DMN/Drools deferred).

Success Criteria
* Demonstrate end-to-end flow: Guidewire JSON → CDM → Mapping → Rating Engine (mock) → Response → Re-transformation → Guidewire JSON.
* Show that business users can create/modify mappings without developer intervention.
* Reusable connectors and mapping artifacts prove plug-and-play potential.
* Iterative mapping changes tracked via JIRA backlog.
* AI suggestions generate at least one valid mapping.
* Prototype runs reliably on Kubernetes.
